# RoomifyAR — Furniture E‑Commerce & AR (Flutter)

RoomifyAR is a cross‑platform Flutter application for browsing, previewing, and purchasing furniture. It blends a modern e‑commerce flow with 3D and AR previews so users can visualize items in their space before buying.

App title (in code): `RoomifyAR`

## Highlights

- Authentication: Email/password with Firebase Auth, plus Google Sign‑In
- Product catalog with details, images, and 3D models (`.glb`)
- AR/3D preview via `model_viewer_plus`, `augmented_reality_plugin`, and `flutter_3d_controller`
- Cart, checkout flow, and orders
- Payment integration (Chapa)
- Media management with Firebase Storage and Cloudinary (incl. background removal pipeline)
- Theming (light/dark) persisted with `GetStorage`
- Navigation with `go_router`

## Tech Stack

- Flutter (Dart >= 3.4)
- State management: `provider` + `get_it` (DI)
- Routing: `go_router`
- Firebase: `firebase_core`, `firebase_auth`, `cloud_firestore`, `firebase_storage`
- Identity: `google_sign_in`
- Local storage: `get_storage`
- UI/UX: `google_fonts`, `animate_do`, `carousel_slider`, `flutter_svg`, `lottie`, `flutter_spinkit`
- Media & device: `image_picker`, `url_launcher`, `path_provider`
- 3D/AR: `model_viewer_plus`, `augmented_reality_plugin`, `flutter_3d_controller`
- Payments: `chapasdk`
- Cloud images: `cloudinary_flutter`, `cloudinary_url_gen`

See all declared dependencies in [`pubspec.yaml`](./pubspec.yaml).

## App Structure

Key directories under `lib/`:

- `main.dart` — App entry: initializes Firebase, DI (`get_it`), `GetStorage`, system UI, and providers; configures router and theme
- `firebase_options.dart` — Generated by FlutterFire (platform options for Firebase)
- `core/`
    - `features/`
        - `auth/` — Auth views and logic (login, signup, wrapper)
        - `main/` — Main features: `home/`, `cart/`, `productDetail/`, `profile/`, `payment/`, `search/`, `itemUpload/`, `services/`
        - `splash/` — Splash screen
    - `routes/` — `go_router` routes and route names
    - `locator/` — DI setup for `get_it`
    - `provider/` — Global providers (auth, theme, etc.)
    - `utils/`, `helper/`, `components/`, `global/` — Shared utilities and UI

Routes are defined in `lib/core/routes/routes.dart` with names in `route_name.dart` (e.g., `splashView`, `loginView`, `signUpView`, `mainView`, `cartView`, `homeView`, `profileView`, `productDetailView`, `orderView`, `termsAndConditionsView`, `contactUsView`, `aboutUsView`).

Assets:

- `assets/images/`, `assets/icons/`, `assets/lottie/`, `assets/models/`
- 3D models: see `assets/models/*.glb`

## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK 3.4+ (Dart >= 3.4)
- A Firebase project (Auth, Firestore, Storage enabled)
- Platform SDKs: Android Studio (Android SDK), Xcode (for iOS/macOS)
- Optional third‑party accounts: Cloudinary, Chapa

## Setup

1) Clone and install packages

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yiheyistm/furniture_e_commerce.git
cd furniture_e_commerce
flutter pub get
```

2) Configure Firebase

This project expects `firebase_options.dart` (present) and the platform config files. If you need to regenerate or re‑link:

- Install FlutterFire CLI and run:
    - `flutterfire configure` (select your Firebase project and platforms)
- Ensure platform files exist:
    - Android: `android/app/google-services.json`
    - iOS/macOS: `ios/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`, `macos/Runner/GoogleService-Info.plist`

3) Configure third‑party services (development)

The app reads API keys from an asset file for development: `assets/secret_api_key.json` (declared in `pubspec.yaml` as `secret_api_key.json`). Replace placeholder values with your own:

```json
{
    "CLOUD_NAME": "<your-cloudinary-cloud-name>",
    "API_KEY": "<your-cloudinary-api-key>",
    "API_SECRET": "<your-cloudinary-api-secret>",
    "API_NAME_REMOVE_IMAGE_BACKGROUND": "<your-cloudinary-function-name>",
    "API_KEY_REMOVE_IMAGE_BACKGROUND": "<your-bg-removal-api-key>",
    "CHAPA_API_KEY": "<your-chapa-public-key>"
}
```

Important: Do not commit real secrets in production. Prefer secure delivery (remote config, server side, or platform‑level secret management). The current approach is for local development convenience.

4) (Optional) Generate launcher icons

```sh
flutter pub run flutter_launcher_icons
```

## Run

Start the app on a connected device or emulator:

```sh
flutter run
```

To run for a specific platform:

- Android: `flutter run -d android`
- iOS: `flutter run -d ios` (requires macOS/Xcode)
- Web: `flutter run -d chrome` (AR features may be limited)

## Build

- Android release (example): `flutter build apk --release`
- iOS release: `flutter build ios --release` (requires code signing)

## AR/3D Notes

- Android: AR features may require devices that support ARCore. Some emulators do not support AR.
- iOS: AR features may require ARKit‑capable devices; simulators do not support AR.
- Web/Desktop: `model_viewer_plus` can render 3D; native AR is limited or unavailable.

## Troubleshooting

- Missing Firebase configuration
    - Ensure `firebase_options.dart` matches your project or re‑run `flutterfire configure`.
    - Confirm `google-services.json` (Android) / `GoogleService-Info.plist` (iOS/macOS) are in place.
- Google Sign‑In errors
    - Verify OAuth consent screen and Client IDs in Firebase console; update reversed client ID on iOS if needed.
- AR not working on device/emulator
    - Check ARCore/ARKit support and use a real device where necessary.
- Asset not found
    - Confirm the asset path is listed under `flutter.assets` in `pubspec.yaml` and run `flutter pub get`.
